# Python DS Project: Music Recommendation
xgboost to predict if people will like a music or not
Programming Language: Python

### Problem Statement:
While the public’s now listening to all kinds of music, algorithms still struggle in key areas. Without enough historical data, how would an algorithm know if listeners will like a new song or a new artist? And, how would it know what songs to recommend brand new users?

WSDM has challenged the Kaggle ML community to help solve these problems and build a better music recommendation system. The dataset is from KKBOX, Asia’s leading music streaming service, holding the world’s most comprehensive Asia-Pop music library with over 30 million tracks. They currently use a collaborative filtering based algorithm with matrix factorization and word embedding in their recommendation system but believe new techniques could lead to better results.

### Data
- train_full: 19 variables, 7 million+
observations
- test_full: 19 variables, 2 million+
observations

### Final Model
Xgboost
